# GoodGrowth - TechTest

*Spent 5 hours from allowed time of 3 - 5*

## Brief

The National Trust would like to have their propertiesâ€™ information pages (e.g. here) display the weather in that propertyâ€™s location. Their belief is that this additional information will increase the probability of users visiting a property. They are unable to make any changes to their website other than to add your JavaScript script to their site.

## Task objectives

1. **Understanding the Constraints:**

- I can only add a JavaScript script to the National Trust website.
- I needed to fetch and display weather data using the provided API.
- I could not modify the websiteâ€™s backend or HTML structure.
- Ideally, the solution should be A/B testable to measure impact.
- I should ensure the script is lightweight and efficient.

2. **Investigate Available Data & Hooks:**

- Check localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies, or global JavaScript variables for useful location data.
- Use the Network tab in DevTools to inspect what information is already being fetched.

## Summary of how the code works (Non-Technical)

This code is a small program that automatically fetches and displays weather information on the National Trust webpage. Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown of what it does:

**1. Loads a Design File:** It first loads a stylesheet (a file that controls how the page looks) from an external source to ensure the weather section is styled correctly.

**2. Waits for the Page to Load:** Before doing anything, it waits until the webpage is fully ready to make sure everything is in place.

**3. Finds the Weather Section:** It looks for a specific part of the webpage where the weather information should be displayed.

**4. Fetches Weather Data:** It contacts an external weather service (API) and asks for weather details about a specific location (coordinates near Mount Everest).

**5. Displays Weather Information:** If the data is valid, it creates and displays:

- The name of the city and country
- Population and location coordinates
- Current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more
- A weather icon representing the current conditions
- Handles Errors: If something goes wrong (e.g., the webpage section is missing or the weather service fails), it shows an error message instead of breaking the webpage.

**In non-technical terms, this code automatically displays mock weather information on a webpage in a well-organised and visually appealing way, placing it in the section that best fits its purpose.**

## Try it out for yourself

**1. Navigate to https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit, then click on any area and then place you'd like to visit.**

*Or alternatively, click here for example page*
https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/bath-bristol/tyntesfield?origin=search



**2. Access the Chrome Dev Tools by pressing "F12"**

*or alternatively*
![Image of accessing the dev tools using chrome menu](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.chrome.com%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fdevtools%2Fopen%2Fimage%2Fthe-developer-tools-optio-2d9d9b7c0ac96_2880.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=4f02006465386b2832362bd817f8dbdbfeeb9bd89cff8fa2d84abddf53a8dab8&ipo=images)



**3. Click to the console tab as displayed below:**

![Image of console tab](https://developer.chrome.com/static/docs/devtools/console/image/the-console-panel-next-t-9c932aff8f795_856.png)



**4. Copy and paste the following code:**

```
let script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = 'https://l-brookling.github.io/GG-TechTest/index.js';
script.onload = () => console.log("Script loaded successfully!");
script.onerror = (error) => console.error("Error loading script:", error);
script.defer = true;
document.head.appendChild(script);
```



**5. Press "Enter" and scroll down to the "Planning your visit" section.**

*You should then see something similar to the updated version*

## Decisions

**1. Why I chose to display the information in the "Planning your trip" section:**
- Didn't want to flood the location overview with weather information as it wouldn't be relevant to the place if they just wanted to see the location information.
- If they were curious about visiting the location then it makes sense to me displaying it in that section.

**2. Not storing the API key in a .env file:**
- Given that this only contained mock data and nothing sensitive I chose to go without the .env folder and calling the API key with process.env.API_KEY.
- I am very familiar with keeping sensitive information hidden and did try to attempt the implementation of this strategy, but I ran into an error with this script when doing so and chose to focus my time on adding styling to show off frontend skills.

## Challenges & Learnings

**Key Takeaways:**
**1. Remove DOMContentLoaded event listener from the function:**
```
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
...existing code
})

to this...

(function() {
...existing code
})()
// This is incorrect if I am to be loading the script manually in the console, but it took a lot of searching on the web and my bootcamp mentor ended up giving me very helpful insight.
```

**2. Calling weatherInfoDiv at top level so that it is reachable:**
```
(function () {

  // Needs to be declared top level so that it is not out of scope
  let weatherInfoDiv;

})()
```
**3. Combining both CSS and JS scripts into one file:**
```
(function () {
  // Add CSS stylesheet function at the top level
  function loadStyles() {
    const link = document.createElement("link");
    link.rel = "stylesheet";
    link.href = "https://l-brookling.github.io/GG-TechTest/styles.css";
    link.onload = () => console.log("Stylesheet loaded successfully!");
    link.onerror = (error) => console.error("Error loading stylesheet:", error);
    document.head.appendChild(link);
  }
})()
```
**4. Deploying my repo on GitHub Pages and injecting it into the console.** *This was my first time doing both of these tasks and it was a great learning experience.*
**5. Using the Chrome Dev Tools to inspect cookies and what requests have been made.** *Not fully confident on what evidence I could show, but given more time I would love to dig deeper into what information I could extract from them.*

## Future Improvements

**1. Dynamically adding the image coordinates for the location instead of using the mock API coordinates.**
Using the Dev Tools I found the google maps coordinates for the location:
![Google maps image](/img\Google-maps-coordinates.PNG)
...and using a piece of code similar to this:
```
function extractCoordinates(url) {
    const urlObj = new URL(url);
    const params = new URLSearchParams(urlObj.search);
    const destination = params.get("destination");

    if (destination) {
        const [latitude, longitude] = destination.split(",").map(coord => parseFloat(coord.trim()));
        return { latitude, longitude };
    }
    return null;
}

const url = "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination=50.638307%2C-4.3623079";
const { latitude, longitude } = extractCoordinates(url);
```
I would be able to:
- Extract the destination parameter from the URL.
- Use .split(",") to separate latitude and longitude into an array.
- Use .map(parseFloat) to convert the values from strings to numbers.
- Return the latitude and longitude as an object so they can be easily injected into the API request e.g. /recruitment-mock-weather-endpoint/forecast?appid=a2ef86c41a*lat=${latitude}&lon={longitude}*

*Sadly I only had about 15 minutes before my time ran out to figure out how to implement this, so I took to researching it and not including it*

**2. Improving the overall aesthetic and potential animations for the weather icon:**
- If I had more time I would've liked to improve the layout mainly with the weather icon so that instead of it being a blurry, far too seperate image, I would've made it animated to reflect the weather pattern. For example, If the weather was sunny, I would have the image pulse and glow very softly. If it was raining, I would animate the raindrops to pulse and the clouds to subtly change between a darker and lighter shade.

**A-B testing**

As far as recieving feedback from my script and it's enhancements to the website, I have reached out to The National Trust to see if they could provide any feedback

###### Side note: Just wanted to say a massive thank you to Good Growth for the challenge as I have learnt so many interesting new skills and understand more about the Dev Tools and it's capabilities. *Such a fun challenge, can't wait to keep on learning more.*
